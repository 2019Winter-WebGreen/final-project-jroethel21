            <h1 class="title">Biography</h1>
            <p>Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani student and education activist. She is known for her activism for girls' and women's rights, especially for being allowed to go to school. Yousafzai is originally from the town of Mingora in the Swat District. She was a victim of a gunshot attack in October 2012. Yousafzai is the youngest person to have won the Nobel Peace Prize. She won the prize in October 2014 at the age of 17.</p>
            <p>On October 9, 2012, when 15-year-old Malala was riding a bus with friends on their way home from school, a masked gunman boarded the bus and demanded to know which girl was Malala. When her friends looked toward Malala, her identity was given away. The gunman fired at her, hitting Malala in the left side of her head.</p>

            <p>On October 10, 2013, in acknowledgement of her work, the European Parliament awarded Yousafzai with the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. In April 2017, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres appointed Yousafzai as a U.N. Messenger of Peace to promote girls education. The appointment is the highest honor given by the United Nations for an initial period of two years. Yousafzai was also given honorary Canadian citizenship in April 2017. She is the sixth person and the youngest in the country’s history to receive the honor. <a href="https://www.malala.org" target="_blank"> The Malala Fund</a> was founded by Malala and Ziauddin Yousafzai in 2013 to champion every girl’s right to 12 years of free, safe, quality education." </p>
